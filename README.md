This project is a "portal" page that allows students and professors to recieve information
relevent to them from a database by submitting their student id no. or ssn, respectively.  
  
To run locally:  
- install `mariadb` and make sure it's running
- create a db and source `database.sql` and `data.sql` (in that order)
- use `php -S localhost:8000` at the project root (use whichever port you like)
